.terraform.lock.hcl   # Dependency lock file (though often you might want to commit this for consistent builds)

# Terraform state files - CRITICAL to ignore if using local state
# If you are using a remote backend (like S3), these won't be created,
# but it's still good practice to include them for safety.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
terraform.tfstate
terraform.tfstate.backup

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Terraform plan files
*.tfplan

# sensitive variable files (e.g., for local testing)
# NEVER commit files with actual credentials or sensitive data!
# You should manage sensitive data through environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager,
# or a secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault.
# Examples of files you might create locally but NOT commit:
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json
override.tf
override.tf.json

# Providers' cache
.terraform/providers/

# Editor-specific files (common ones)
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.bak
